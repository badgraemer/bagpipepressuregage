Project Summary
Setting up a real-time bagpipe pressure monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi and Arduino (specifically, the XIAO ESP32C3) with a BMP280 pressure sensor. High-level overview:

Raspberry Pi: Acts as an MQTT broker and hosts a Node.js server to manage connections for real-time data visualization.

XIAO ESP32C3: Reads pressure data from the BMP280 sensor, sends this data via MQTT to the Raspberry Pi, which then forwards it to web clients.

Web Client: A web application uses Chart.js to visualize pressure data in real-time, receiving updates from the Raspberry Pi.
